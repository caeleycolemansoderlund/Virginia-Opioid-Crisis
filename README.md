## Background

* The [**opioid crisis**](https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/about/index.html) remains one of the most devastating public health emergencies in the United States, claiming over **80,000** lives in 2022 alone, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/about/understanding-the-opioid-overdose-epidemic.html). 

* **Fentanyl**, the illegally-made synthetic opioid, is responsible for **90%** of all opioid-related deaths, and **68%** of all drug overdose deaths in the US, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/about/index.html?utm_) and the [DEA](https://www.dea.gov/resources/facts-about-fentanyl).

* As the [Brookings Insititute](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-fentanyl-pipeline-and-chinas-role-in-the-us-opioid-crisis/?utm_) explains, **chemical precursors for fentanyl manufacturing** are produced in China and shipped to Mexico, where they are synthesized into fentanyl and distributed by cartels. According to the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg93nn1e6go?utm_), this supply route is responsible for **98%** of all fentanyl entering the United States.

* In 2023, **27,000 pounds** of fentanyl was seized at the US-Mexico border, according to the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/drug-seizure-statistics) and as reported by [the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg93nn1e6go?utm_). Given the drug‚Äôs extreme potency, even a small amount can be deadly:

<strong>‚ò†Ô∏èEstimated lethal dose <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg93nn1e6go?utm_"></strong>: as little as **2 mg**, according to the [DEA](https://www.dea.gov/resources/facts-about-fentanyl) </a><br>
<strong>üöîTotal fentanyl seized</strong>: 27,000 lbs = <strong>12,246,993,990 mg</strong><br>
<strong>üî¢Potential lethal doses</strong>: 11,339,809,250 mg √∑ 2 mg = <strong>6,123,496,995</strong><br>
‚ö†Ô∏è That‚Äôs theoretically enough to kill over <strong>6.1 billion people</strong> ‚Äî more than 18√ó the U.S. population.
